Vowch.it is an android app that uses social pressure to help individuals achieve goals and stick with routines. Users are held accountable for the the things they set out to do - members of the community need to vowch for a user’s actions in order for them to count as valid. “Vowching” is done in the form of validation of text, pictures, videos, and other media that the user can provide as evidence for their actions. More reputable members of the community have a bigger say in whether a piece of evidence is valid or not and become more reputable by vowching fairly and accomplishing goals.
